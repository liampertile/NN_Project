Implementing a neural network using the Adult dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It's a classification problem.

Basic MLP (3 layers): I used ReLU in the hidden layers and a sigmoid activation in the output layer.

Currently, I'm studying why the improvement slows down after 2000 epochs
